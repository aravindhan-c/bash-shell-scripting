# bash-shell-scripting

Devops and cloud engineers should focus on:
* Basic commands - understand file operations (e.g., ls, cp, mv, rv), text processing tools (grep, sed, awk) and file permissions
* Scripting basics - writing simple scripts to automate tasks. This includes, loops (for, while) and conditionals (if, else)
* Text processing - Practise using gep, awk, sed and cut for extracting and manipulating text from files
* Process management - Manage processes using commands like ps, top, kill, and nohup
* Automation - Automate tasks like backups, monitoring and deployments using shell scripts
